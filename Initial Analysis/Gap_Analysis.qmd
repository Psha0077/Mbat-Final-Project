## Gap Analysis

**Introduction**

Educate Plus (The organization) is a membership organization for professionals working in the education sector, primarily in Australia and New Zealand. The organization supports individuals involved in areas such as admissions, alumni and community relations, fundraising, and marketing and communications within educational institutions. Educate Plus provides training, networking opportunities, and resources to help professionals enhance their skills and stay up-to-date with industry trends.

Consisting of a database of over two thousand members across schools and colleges, universities, professional training institutes and consultancies associated with the education sector, Educate Plus is looking to leverage their membership, billing and events attendance data into actionable insights.

**Objective**

The objective of this report is to provide a gap analysis is to identify the differences between the current reporting framework and the desired framework of the organization. This report aims to understand the limitations of the current reporting framework and will outline proposed solutions to bridge the gap to fulfill the reporting needs of the organization.

**Current System Analysis**

The current reporting framework involves the use of Google sheets that have been manually entered into the CRM platform CiviCRM. This is then sent to a Google Sheet acting as a staging dashboard to prepare the data into a format that can be visualized. VIsualization is done using Google LookerStudio.

The current reporting dashboard can be seen in figures 2 and 3.

: Table 1: Members Dashboard requirements for Educate Plus

As can be seen, the current dashboard meets the following requirements;

-   **Members By Membership Type**:

    -   The dashboard shows membership by type (e.g., Corporate, Individual), fulfilling the need to track membership distribution by different types.

-   **New Member Numbers**:

    -   The "New Members by Type" section lists the count of new members by chapter, satisfying the requirement to track the number of new members.

-   **Membership by Chapter and Country**:

    -   The dashboard visualizes "Membership % by Chapter" and also includes a map showing membership by country, satisfying the need for tracking membership by location, chapter, and country.

-   **Membership by Institution Type and School Type**:

    -   The "Membership by Institution Type" section fulfills the need to track members by different institution and school types.

        -   **Event Return on Investment (ROI)**: Assesses the financial and engagement impact of events, ensuring resources are well spent.

**Implementation Plan**

To implement the proposed dashboard solutions for Educate Plus, we will follow a structured approach to ensure each dashboard meets the organization's needs effectively.

First, we will build a dashboard wireframe, which will serve as a visual blueprint outlining the layout and data visualization for each dashboard. This initial design will then be shared with the organization to gather their feedback and ensure alignment with their expectations and requirements.

Once we receive feedback, the next step involves sharing the necessary columns and data points with the third-party IT team responsible for building the new dashboards. This collaboration ensures that the technical foundation is correctly set up in LookerStudio, aligning with the organization's data structure.

Following the construction phase, we will proceed to build each dashboard in LookerStudio, translating the wireframe design into fully functional, interactive dashboards. Post-development, we will engage in another round of feedback with the organization, allowing them to review the dashboards and suggest any necessary adjustments.

After implementing the feedback, we will conduct thorough testing of each dashboard. This step is crucial to ensure that the data visualizations accurately reflect the organization's data and that all numbers match up across different dashboards. Finally, once all testing is complete and the dashboards are validated, we will proceed to launch each dashboard, making them accessible for use by Educate Plus to support their strategic and operational objectives.

**Conclusion**

**\
** This gap analysis highlights the critical areas where the current reporting framework for Educate Plus falls short and proposes comprehensive solutions to bridge these gaps. The current dashboard, while covering some essential metrics, lacks depth in areas such as member retention, demographic insights, and year-on-year growth tracking. By implementing the proposed Members Dashboard, Membership Dashboard, and Events Dashboard, Educate Plus will gain a holistic view of its membership data, enabling more informed decision-making and strategic planning.

The proposed implementation plan ensures a methodical approach to developing these dashboards, starting with wireframes, gathering feedback, and involving a third-party IT team to ensure technical accuracy. The iterative process of building, testing, and refining these dashboards will culminate in a suite of tools that not only meet the organization's current needs but also provide a robust foundation for future growth. These dashboards will empower Educate Plus to leverage its data effectively, driving member engagement, optimizing resource allocation, and ultimately fulfilling its mission to support professionals in the education sector.
