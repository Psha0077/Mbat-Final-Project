## Weekly Log - Members Dashboard

**Introduction**

EducatePlus needs a dashboard to report the figures of their member numbers for the sake of their weekly and monthly reporting, keeping track of member-specific metrics.

**Approach**

We followed an iterative process to build the Members Dashboard.

**Step 1: Stakeholder Identification & Requirements Gathering**

We sent out surveys to the EducatePlus team members to understand their reporting requirements in order to identify the relevant stakeholders and their different use cases.

Relevant stakeholders: Memberships team, CEO & Business Owner.

| Requirement/ Metric \| Description \|

| **Members by Membership Type** \| Helps in understanding the distribution of different membership categories, allowing EducatePlus to tailor services and resources to specific member types.. \|
| **Lapsed/Cancelled Member Numbers**: \| Tracks the effectiveness of recruitment efforts and indicates the growth of the organization. \|
| **Member Numbers to Budget** \| Ensures that membership growth aligns with financial targets, which is crucial for planning and sustainability. \|
| **Membership by Gender** \| Provides insights into gender diversity within the organization, which can inform targeted initiatives to improve inclusivity. \|
| **Membership by Age** \| Helps in understanding the age distribution, allowing for the development of programs and communications tailored to different age groups. \|
| **Membership by Location (Chapter and Country)**: \| Enables EducatePlus to understand regional distribution and ensure that all areas are adequately supported and represented. \|
| **Membership by Institution Type and School Classification** \| Helps in identifying which types of institutions are most engaged, allowing for targeted outreach and support. \|
| **Member Interests** \| Provides data to create more personalized and engaging content, events, and resources, ultimately increasing member satisfaction and engagement. \|

**Step 2: Dashboard Wireframe & Feedback**

Having understood the relevant stakeholders and their needs, we began by designing wireframe diagrams of the dashboard with the EducatePlus members, after multiple rounds of feedback, we came up with a final draft seen in Figure 1.

**Step 3: Data Preparation**

Having understood the Organization's needs, identifying stakeholders and agreeing upon the final dashboard design, we began implementing it. The current staging database is a Google Sheet consisting 19 columns across multiple variables. Reporting the needed metrics required the addition of rows. This was done with the help of the IT team from EducatePlus.

| Column in Existing Staging Database (Google Sheet) | Column in New Staging Database | Description                                                                                                |

**Step 4: Dashboard Building & Testing**

We built the dashboard and this is how it looks.

![Image 4: Member Dashboard Page 2](Images/Member%20Dashboard%20Page%202.png)

**Challenges Faced**

1.  There is an issue with our current members count. The number we are getting is a lot lower than that being used by the current IT dashboard. This is due to the fact that the current dashboard counts in the total cancelled members as well. We are currently in talks with the team to discuss this formula.

We fixed the issue of the current dashboard numbers as we sent them the duplicate values as well as missing ones, and they imported it directly from the Civi CRM.

2.  We have noticed that the dashboard keeps crashing requiring us to manually reset each visualization and metric. We have removed the date dimension as a way to solve this and also ensured to re-connect the data source. This should solve the problem.

3.  The dataset contained numerous null values. The rows with null values were excluded from the final dashboard using a filter in Looker Studio itself to ensure consistency in the data. This exclusion was necessary to avoid misrepresentation of memberships and maintain clean reporting.
